## How To Use

### Initial Setup

After cloning the project first time, run following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

### Starting Dev Server

The following commands starts the dev server on http://localhost:3000. You can
read more about the dev server in the
[documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#development).

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Setup Sentry

Set the environment variables as defined in .env.example. Also see [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/).

### Plop

You can use plop to create pages and api routes in the cli. Plop makes sure every new page
conforms to predefined standards.

To run plop and get prompts for creating a new page run:

```javascript
pnpm plop
```

## Nice to Know

### Commitlint

We use commitlint to enforce commit style. If you would like to add new type enums or change the settings you can do so in the commitlint.config.js file.

### VS Code Debugging

General purpose launch settings for vs code are located in the .vscode/launch.json file. You can run these pre-defined debug sessions in your vs code debug tab.

### Project Structure

The main directories in the project are structured as following:

```
▸ .github
▸ .storybook
▸ cypress
▸ public
▾ src
  ▸ components
  ▸ config
  ▸ layouts
  ▸ pages
  ▸ styles
  ▸ types
  ▸ util
▸ test
```

#### .github

The project already comes with defaults for github-actions. This directory contains
the main workflow which runs all the tests of the repository and then creates a new release
with semantic-release. When it comes to deployment and vercel you might like to
use [vercel-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vercel-action) to run
all these scripts before the deployment to vercel or just run all scripts
in one build command on vercel (ready to use: pnpm ci:test-build)

#### .storybook

All storybook config goes into this directory. See
[documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview)

#### cypress

Standard cypress (typescript) installation folder. See
[documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Folder-structure)

#### Public

This directory is where all the static assets are stored. Also contains i18n translations
that will be injected by next-i18next. translationNamespaces in baseStaticHandler refers to
these file names. See [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving)
for further questions.

#### Src

##### Components

All of the React components that are used on different parts of the project can
be found under this directory. These components are usually single responsibility
pieces that are handling their own logic and styling.

##### Config

Config files for global config rules.

##### Layouts

This directory contains main layouts used to wrap pages and large parts of the
user interface.

##### Pages

This is a directory specific to NextJS. It contains a React component per
route in the website. You can
read more about how routing is handled in a NextJS project
[here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).

##### Styles

This directory contains definitions for different CSS variables that are used
around the project. It contains a global.css file that handles basic styling for all
elements and a stitches.config.ts file that instantiates a new stitches instance
and sets configuration for our design system.

##### Types

Global Typescript Types. All .d.ts files in this directory are automatically
included into typescript.

##### Util

This directory contains several utility files for different functionalities.

#### Test

Config/Setup Files for jest and testing-library.
